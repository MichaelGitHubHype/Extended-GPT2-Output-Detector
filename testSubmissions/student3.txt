This is the fifth time you are TAing me. How?

I heard this question a lot in the past semester.

I have spent the past three years working as a teaching assistant. Every year I applied to the most advanced courses I could teach. While I felt like a beginner, I got great reviews and helped many students.

In this blog post, I will walk through the main lessons I learned — how I helped students, maintained WLB, answered questions, and ran tutorials.

My First Experience
I started TAing in the first online semester. I was a second-year student, and I was a lecture TA for students just one year below me.

Before the first lecture, the professor sent all TAs the lecture exercise and the solution. I studied the solution and understood it. I was ready.

In the lecture, we divided students into breakout rooms. I was in charge of helping 3 breakout rooms.

I joined breakout room 1. They were discussing the exercise. I listened for a minute. No questions, so I moved to room 2.

Room 2 talked using the chat. I read the chat messages. No questions, I moved to room 3.

Room 3 was quiet. Complete silence. I waited for another minute. Still silence.

Finally, something for me to do!

I unmuted and I asked the students how is it going.

I waited in the breakout room for someone to say something. Anything. Yet, there was no reply.

Nothing.

Finally, the professor closed the breakout rooms. I am free from this awkwardness, I think.

Yet the same pattern continued over the next two weeks. I felt like I wasn’t making enough impact. I wanted to figure out how to improve. This is when I learned…
