Canada's history can be traced back to the arrival of Indigenous peoples thousands of years ago. French explorer Jacques Cartier arrived in 1534, claiming Canada for France, and in 1763, the British gained control through the Treaty of Paris. The 19th century saw the growth and development of Canada, including the addition of new provinces and territories, and the formation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867. In the 20th century, Canada played a role in both World Wars, and the country's economy and infrastructure grew rapidly. In 1949, Canada became fully independent from the UK. Today, Canada is a multicultural, federal parliamentary democracy with a population of over 37 million.
